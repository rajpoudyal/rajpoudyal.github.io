[{"categories":["Java"],"content":"This article explains about class and object used in Java, providing with real world example of it.\nDefinition of Object oriented program  It is a computer programming modle that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than function and logic.  Function:\nIt is a reusable portion somtimes called procedure and (subroutine..block of code only used when run).\n For example  Explaination of class and object    * Class:  Class is a group of objects of similar properties. For more, it is like an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects.\n* Object:  Object is called as an instance(an example or single occurrence of something) of class having identical identity, a behaviour and a state.\n2.  In programming, object is usually a non-primitive data type of class called by using \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; keyword mostly in string and array which is used to store complex values.\nNon-primitive data type: This are the data type which donot have fixed sizes. In these datatype, variable size are usually declared with a ‘new’ keyword.\n - Eg:Array,string,etc  Relationship between class and object  A class is a blueprint for the object. Before we create an object, we first need to define the class. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object. Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.  Real world example of class and object   For instance\n If animal is the class than dog, cat, rat, etc can be consider as the object, For more, if bike is the class than mountainbike, racing/sportsbike, touringbike, etc can be said as object of class bike.    Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state(field and variable) and behavior(methods).\n Dogs have field(name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior(barking, fetching, wagging tail). In the same way, Bike also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and methods (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes).    In programming concept     * Java class  We can create a class in Java using the class keyword. For example,\n   Here, fields (variables) and methods represent the state and behavior of the object respectively.\n fields are used to store data methods are used to perform some operations    For our bike object, we can create the class as\n In the above example, we have created a class named bike. It contains a field named gear and a method named braking().\nHere, bike is a prototype. Now, we can create any number of bikes using the prototype. And, all the bikes will share the fields and methods of the prototype.\n Note: We have used keywords private and public. These are known as access modifiers.     * Java object  Here is how we can create an object of a class.\n We have used the new keyword along with the constructor of the class to create an object. Constructors are similar to methods and have the same name as the class. For example, Bike() is the constructor of the bike class.\n","date":"Jul 27, 2022","img":"","largeImg":"","permalink":"https://rajpoudyal.github.io/posts/java-for-beginners/explaination-of-class-and-object-in-java/","series":null,"smallImg":"","tags":["Java","Class and object"],"title":"Explaination of Class and Object in Java"},{"categories":["Java"],"content":"This article explains method of installing of JDK in Windows. Also to verify JDK after instillation.\nBackground  The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a distribution of Java Technology by Oracle Corporation. It implements the Java Language Specification (JLS) and the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS) and provides the Standard Edition (SE) of the Java Application Programming Interface (API). It provides software for working with Java applications. Examples of included software are the virtual machine, a compiler, performance monitoring tools, a debugger, and other utilities that Oracle considers useful for a Java programmer. - wikipedia.org \n Download JDK   Search JDK download at search engine,\n  Open Java download of oracle website,\n   Choose the correct OS according for specific JDK (Windows,Mac,Linux),   Scrool or search for compactiable installer for your platform,   Click on related installer and accept terms and condition then click on download,   After some time download will be completed.  Install JDK  Once the download is complete go to downloads at My PC where you find the JDK application,    Then, execute(open) the file to begin the installation of JDK,\n  After you double click the JDK file, a pop up asking you where your source java file will be (You can choose to change but better to stick with original location). Click next to all criteria,\n   Then, after some time JDK will be install in your device,  Set environment variable  Go to search menu and search advanced system settings,   Select Advanced System Setting. Click on Environment Variables (at the bottom right corner),    There will be two environment variables, one is the User variable and another is a System variable.\n  If path and classpath variables are already present in System Variable, click on it to edit. Otherwise, set a new variable.\nUser variable :      For New :\n Select New,    Add the variable name and variable value as following,    For variable value set location of jdk,     For Edit,\nSet only variable value.\nSystem Variable :    For New :\nSelect New, add the variable name as Path and variable value as below,\n  For Edit :\n  Select path and click edit,\n  Edit environmental variable as following,\n    Set the classpath variable by adding the following classpath directory path,   Then, Click on apply and ok on system properties.\nNow, you have done with Java JDK setup.    Verify Installiation We can use javac -version to find out the version of the installed JDK.\n  We have to open command prompt,\n  Then, type javac -version and hit enter,\n  JDK version will be displayed.\n   In the above example, the JDK version is 18.0.1\n","date":"May 26, 2022","img":"","largeImg":"","permalink":"https://rajpoudyal.github.io/posts/java-for-beginners/setup-jdk-in-windows/","series":null,"smallImg":"","tags":["JDK","Windows"],"title":"Setup JDK in Windows"},{"categories":null,"content":"Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.
